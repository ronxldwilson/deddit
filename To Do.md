# Bug List:

Save button doesn't properly retain state in Post Page
When moving from State post page and saving a post and going back to the home page, the save state is not retained

When a post is saved in home page and then gone to the same post, the save state is not retained

when we go to a subreddit, the post card shows r/tech but when you open it, it will show r/meme

Create post button idempotency is missing

Subreddit posts are not unique

make the saved post entirely DB dependent and not localstorage dependent

Fix Saved Posts and My Comments page
